# Cpp-modules
This repo is a collection of exercises for the cpp modules from 42 Berlin. I will regularly add my solutions to this repo. 
These exercises focus on OOP basics (Object-Oriented Pogramming).

## Questions
What are classes? What is a constructor and destructor? What is overloading? What is encapsulation?
